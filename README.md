## Introduction
### Goal
The goal of this analysis is to aggregate the provded data to identify trends in school performance.

The task is broken down into sections, each requiring a dataframe as an output (provided in [Analysis & Results](https://github.com/alyssahondrade/pandas-challenge/blob/main/README.md#analysis--results)).
- Local Government Area (LGA) Summary - `area_summary`
- School Summary - `per_school_summary`
- Highest Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) - `top_schools`
- Lowest Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) - `bottom_schools`
- Maths Scores by Year - `maths_scores_by_year`
- Reading Scores by Year - `reading_scores_by_year`
- Scores by School Spending - `spending_summary`
- Scores by School Size - `size_summary`
- Scores by School Type - `type_summary`

### Repository Structure
- `PyCitySchools` directory contains the Jupyter notebook of the same name.
- `Resources` directory contains the datasets: [`schools_complete.csv`](https://github.com/alyssahondrade/pandas-challenge/blob/main/Resources/schools_complete.csv) and [`students_complete.csv`](https://github.com/alyssahondrade/pandas-challenge/blob/main/Resources/students_complete.csv).

### Dataset
The datasets were generated by **Mockaroo, LLC (2022) Realistic Data Generator** and **edX Boot Camps LLC**.
